# Code Standards

## General

- Keep modules small and single-purpose.
- Fix root causes — do not layer workarounds.
- Do not mix unrelated concerns in one component or route.

## API Routes

- Validate and parse request input before any logic runs.
- Enforce auth and project ownership checks before any mutation.
- Return consistent, predictable response shapes.
- Keep route handlers thin — push complexity into shared modules or background tasks.

## File Organization

- `lib/` — shared infrastructure: Prisma client, auth helpers, utilities.
- `trigger/` — all durable background tasks and AI workflows.
- `components/` — UI composition only; no business logic.
- `app/api/` — route handlers for auth, triggering, and persistence.
- Name files after the responsibility they contain, not the technology.
